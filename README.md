# DynamicHypergraphs_VCA
Dynamic Hypergraphs are a modified network structure in which an edge can connect more than two nodes. Here, we have created dynamic hypergraphs which can be used for spatiotemporal modeling of biological factors such as inflammatory mediators, genes, etc.

This code was written to accompany a body of work modeling how inflammation spreads between tissue compartments (skin, muscle, plasma) over time following vascularized compartment allotransplantation (VCA). 

We have developed this code here so that tabular and graphical dynamich hypergraphs can be generated for data analysis. 

Quantitative metrics assosciated with hypergraphs, such as edge distribution, can be calculated from the output data.
